# Clustering-and-Classification-in-R
Here I implemented Clustering and Classification of Data in R. 

Data Set description for clustering is given in the Data Set folder. 

For Classification, I used the default credit card clients data set from UCI Machine Learning Repositories.

Any questions regarding the source code, idea, implementation etc. can be routed to me.
