# Data-Reduction-using-PCA-in-R

Here I implemented Data reduction using Principal Component Analysis in R. I used the data set from Big Five Personality Test. Data Set description is given in the Data Set folder. 

Any questions regarding the source code, idea, implementation etc. can be routed to me.
